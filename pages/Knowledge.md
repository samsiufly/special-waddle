- Society values knowledge, intelligence and wisdom
- But knowing the level of your ignorance is important for acquiring knowledge
- Ignorance is dangerous when you think you know everything and it hinders your progress
- An example: you'll make no progress with martial arts if you think of a black belt as being "knowing everything". You'll stop putting in the work and stall.
- But if you're accepting that it's a level of knowledge where you've acquired the basics, and the next steps are re-learning and refining then you'll continue to improve.
- The first thing I did as a black belt was go back to white belt techniques and relearn them but improve them each time.
- Ignorance not so much a shame as being unwilling to learn
- Try to learn something new every day. If you do that then in a year you'll have learned 365 new things and be better off than the year before.

	- [An Effective Way to Organize Your Notes for Writing Books and Articles | Forge](https://forge.medium.com/the-key-to-my-creativity-is-this-weird-note-taking-system-e6704c21f61d) - I've heard that (forgot who) some researchers found there were some limitations when using Zettelkasten method in formal research. While the method can be helpful in generating new ideas based on the existing works and papers, but it also **emphasises this workflow to a certain degree and becomes a subtle limitation to users.**
