- ### Productivity Up
	- As stated in [[Problem-solving]], the last step of problem solving is to optimise and simplify the task after repeating the same task over and over, that could induce problems.
		- [Does Doing the Same Work Over and Over Again Make You Less Ethical? - Harvard Business Review, 2017](https://hbr.org/2017/03/does-doing-the-same-work-over-and-over-again-make-you-less-ethical)
	- Normal workflow: Draft on PPT -> Upload -> 2nd Draft -> Upload
		- The problem is that there is no manageable way to track the changes made to each version, i.e. version control.
		- PPT is not an ideal writing  and brainstorming environment; it's always a final step of the workflow, especially for hundreds of pages of slides.
		- In order not to interrupt the current workflow in our team, I will only enhance my own productivity and keep the final works done by me same as before.
		- The final outputs are still slides and word documents; but the workflow will be changed.
		- I'll try to draft a report or a presentation on an outliner supports [[Markdown]] format, i.e. Logseq or Obsidian.
		- The learning curve is unknown, so I will progressively move towards the optimised workflow.
		- In early stage, copy the rendered text from outliner to PowerPoint or Word.
