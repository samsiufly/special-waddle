- # Welcomeü§≥üèΩ
- Welcome! This site is primarily an exploration of history of Hong Kong & East-Asia, international affairs, politics, social issues, economics, architecture, how to manage knowledge and philosophy. (Early 2021)
- In 2022 I started putting computer related articles and link to here.
- In 2023 I changed the platform from obsidian to Logseq.
- I am still thinking of the name of this site. I can call it my own digital garden or personal wiki. But I want to have a more interesting name. [[Mar 13th, 2023]]
