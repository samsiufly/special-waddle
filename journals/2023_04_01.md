- Today Heiki and I went to a street food place at Mt Gravatt. We came there a bit late so we missed the idol singing performance but I still could see some cosplayers there. I made Derrick's acquaintance yesterday. Derrick from Taiwan is working as a property developer. I think we are a same kind of persons and I got his phone number and Line as well. I will say hi to him later on Tuesday and tell him I can't make it to attend their Japanese activities. But it was great because I am now expanding my social circle here. I also met a japanese (I forget his name but I believe I will meet him later) expat, good at English. I will try to join them later but Tuesday is a little bit difficult. Then we went to a poker place. It's not somewhere I like. But the environment is not as messy as I thought. The staff is nice and the place is very clean. I also met an old man who used to travel to Hong Kong working in film industry decades ago. I still cannot 100% understand what he said but at least I can response. Good!
