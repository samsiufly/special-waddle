- What I did yesterday
	- Townsville solar farm 3D:
		- Imported the 3d model into Lumion and made a few renderings
		- the satellite overlay is still blurry but Lumion has done its best job importing the open source satellite data and topo data
		- I also put some 3d objects into the 3d model such as vehicles and some trees
	- Regional H2 Hub Submission:
		- I created a new account on business.gov.au website and set up the application.
		- The submission is divided into two stages: we are now preparing for the first one.
		- Here I made a summary to have a big picture what we need to do in the coming few weeks
		- And I put those tasks into an excel spreadsheet
		- The item in black are extracted from the application website, which is mandatory; items in another colour were extracted from a powerpoint prepared by Yuli yesterday, that covers more than what we need to submit in stage one.
